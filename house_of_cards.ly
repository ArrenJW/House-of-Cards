	I am a house of cards
	rea -- dy to fall. My
	shoul -- der and my spine
	hold ev -- 'ry thing here.
	They can -- not watch my cards slip.
	They can -- not see me like this. My
	structure it is thin and it weighs me down.

	Shaky hands pray to the ace. They
	try to hold onto the space. But
	winds are too strong, and 
	I cannot hold up the weight of my world
	I can't breathe. And
	I can't see. But
	diamond eyes
	hold up these structures so thin
	and wise.
	I am a house of cards.
	Just watch me fall.
